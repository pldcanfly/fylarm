# Fylarm 

Continuation of [pld-alarm](https://github.com/pldcanfly/pld-alarm)

A Clock application that is designed to run on a raspberry PI. And later on integrate with Home-Assistant or some homebrewn protocol.

Basically a replacement for an Echo Dot which I mainly use just as a clock that plays radio when I need to wake up. I feel it could do more without creepily watching me sleep.

Mainly to learn a bit more about interacting with the desktop, learn audio-handlind and decoding and the fyne-framework.
